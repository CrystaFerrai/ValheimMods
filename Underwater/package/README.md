Adds an option for players to walk along the seafloor instead of swimming at the water surface. This option can be changed in the mod config or by pressing the `Backspace` key in game (key can be changed in config).

This mod was created primarily to assist with placing building pieces underwater. I may try to add diving controls in the future, but for now the options are to swim on the surface or walk on the bottom.

## Installation
This mod is designed to install and run via [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/). You can optionally install it manually following the steps below.

**Manual Install**

1. Install [BepInExPack Valheim](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/)
2. Download latest ``Underwater.dll`` by clicking "Manual Download". Extract the dll from the zip file into ``[GameDirectory]\Bepinex\plugins``. (You only need the dll.)
3. Run the game once, then close it and edit the generated cfg file in ``[GameDirectory]\Bepinex\config`` if you want to customize anything.

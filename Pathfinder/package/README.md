Increases the base map discovery range around the player as well as dynamically adjusts the range based on various visibility factors.

* The base discovery radius is doubled compared to vanilla.
* Discovery radius while on a boat is tripled compared to vanilla.
* Radius increases gradually based on altitude.
* Radius increased by 20% of base during daylight.
* Radius decreased by 10% of base while in a forested area.

Values listed above are defaults. All of them are configurable. Run the game once with the mod enabled to generate the config. See config for details on what each option does.

Plan to add weather based range modifiers in the future.
